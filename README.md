- Calculate their position size using their trade capital, entry and stop loss price

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

Practiced on using OOP to build this project, created some good logics, started out with writing user stories and features for this project. 


### Continued development

Learn more on OOP and how to debug properly as it is very important to know as a developer. Also learn functional programming so as to use that for other projects.

### Useful resources

- StackOverflow
- W3 Schools
